<h2>How It Works ⚡</h2>
<p>
  📌 <strong>Game Start:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click the <strong>START GAME</strong> button to receive two random cards.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  📌 <strong>Game Logic:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The sum of cards determines whether the player can draw more cards or wins/loses.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the sum reaches <strong>21</strong>, the player wins <strong>(Blackjack!)</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the sum exceeds <strong>21</strong>, the player loses <strong>(Bust!)</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  📌 <strong>Drawing a New Card:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Players can draw additional cards using the <strong>NEW CARD</strong> button until a win/loss condition is met.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  📌 <strong>Conditional Button Display:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Buttons dynamically appear or disappear depending on the game state.
  </li>
</ul>
